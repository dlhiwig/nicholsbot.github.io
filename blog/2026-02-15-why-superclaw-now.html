        <h2>Why SuperClaw Now: Independence in the Age of AI Consolidation</h2>

        <p>
          Today, OpenAI acquired OpenClaw. Peter Steinberger, the founder, is joining them. 
          They're calling it a "foundation" and promising it'll stay open source. Maybe it will. 
          But the dynamics have changed.
        </p>

        <h3>What This Means</h3>
        <p>
          OpenClaw was the independent choice for running AI agents. It wasn't tied to any major 
          AI company. You could use it with Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, or any provider you wanted. 
          That neutrality was its strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it belongs to OpenAI. Even if the code stays open, the roadmap, the defaults, the 
          integrations — those will be shaped by OpenAI's interests. That's not necessarily bad. 
          But it's different.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Independence Matters</h3>
        <p>
          AI is becoming critical infrastructure. The agents we build today will handle our emails, 
          manage our schedules, write our code, and make decisions on our behalf. The platforms 
          that run those agents need to be neutral.
        </p>
        <p>
          When one company controls both the model (GPT) and the runtime (OpenClaw), they control 
          the whole stack. That's a lot of power. Maybe they'll use it responsibly. But we shouldn't 
          have to trust that they will.
        </p>

        <h3>Enter SuperClaw</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/dlhiwig/superclaw">SuperClaw</a> started as an extension to 
          OpenClaw — a way to add multi-agent orchestration with proper governance. But the 
          acquisition changes its role.
        </p>
        <p>
          SuperClaw is now positioned as the <strong>independent alternative</strong>. Here's what 
          makes it different:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Multi-provider by design.</strong> Use Claude, GPT, Gemini, Ollama, Kimi, 
          DeepSeek — whatever works for you. No lock-in.</li>
          <li><strong>Governance-first.</strong> Contracts define behavior. Judges resolve conflicts. 
          Every run is logged and auditable.</li>
          <li><strong>Edge-ready.</strong> Run on a Jetson. Run offline. Run air-gapped. Your agent, 
          your hardware.</li>
          <li><strong>Truly open.</strong> MIT license. No "foundation" games. Fork it, modify it, 
          sell it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Road Ahead</h3>
        <p>
          We're launching publicly on February 22. The goal isn't to compete with OpenClaw feature 
          for feature — it's to offer a different philosophy.
        </p>
        <p>
          OpenClaw will likely have more polish, better integrations with OpenAI's ecosystem, and 
          more resources behind it. That's fine. SuperClaw is for people who want independence, 
          auditability, and the freedom to run their agents anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The AI consolidation era has begun. The majors are buying up the infrastructure layer. 
          If you believe in open, independent AI tooling — now's the time to build it.
        </p>
