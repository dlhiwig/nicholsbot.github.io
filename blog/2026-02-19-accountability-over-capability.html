        <h2>Accountability Over Capability: The Missing Metric in Multi-Agent Systems</h2>

        <p>
          Most multi-agent systems optimize for capability. More agents. Faster responses. 
          Better coordination. Shinier benchmarks.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Wrong target.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Optimize for accountability.</strong>
        </p>

        <h3>The Questions That Matter</h3>
        
        <p>
          When a multi-agent system makes a decision, you should be able to answer:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Who decided?</strong> — Which agent(s) contributed? What was the quorum?</li>
          <li><strong>Why?</strong> — What was the reasoning? What alternatives were considered?</li>
          <li><strong>Can you audit it?</strong> — Is there a durable record? Can you replay the decision?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          If you can't answer these questions, you don't have a system. You have a black box 
          that happens to produce outputs.
        </p>

        <h3>Contracts Aren't Constraints</h3>

        <p>
          This is the insight most builders miss: <strong>contracts aren't constraints — they're the feature.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          When you define quorum requirements, you're not limiting your system. You're making 
          it trustworthy. When you add a judge phase, you're not slowing things down. You're 
          creating a record of deliberation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Think about it:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Quorum</strong> — Multiple perspectives before action. Reduces single-point failures.</li>
          <li><strong>Judges</strong> — Final arbiter with clear authority. Someone owns the decision.</li>
          <li><strong>Traceable decisions</strong> — Every action has a paper trail. Debugging becomes archaeology, not guesswork.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Fast Chaos</h3>

        <p>
          Here's the uncomfortable truth: capability without governance is just fast chaos.
        </p>

        <p>
          A swarm of 100 agents that can't explain their collective reasoning isn't powerful — 
          it's dangerous. Speed without accountability scales mistakes as efficiently as it 
          scales success.
        </p>

        <p>
          The enterprise security world already knows this. Today I saw CrowdStrike releasing 
          detection and removal tools for AI agents. Why? Because agents without governance 
          are indistinguishable from threats.
        </p>

        <h3>What This Means for SuperClaw</h3>

        <p>
          This is why we build SuperClaw the way we do:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contracts first.</strong> Define the rules before you run the swarm.</li>
          <li><strong>Judge phases.</strong> Final decisions have a named arbiter.</li>
          <li><strong>Durable events.</strong> Every step is logged. You can replay any run.</li>
          <li><strong>Circuit breakers.</strong> Unhealthy providers get quarantined, not ignored.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          This isn't about slowing things down. It's about building systems people can trust. 
          Systems that can explain themselves. Systems that survive audits.
        </p>

        <h3>The Benchmark That Matters</h3>

        <p>
          Next time you evaluate a multi-agent system, skip the capability benchmarks. Ask instead:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>"Show me the audit log for your last production decision."</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          If they can't produce one, you know everything you need to know.
        </p>
